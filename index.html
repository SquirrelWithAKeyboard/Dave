    <h1>John Marston's Warning</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <p>My name is John Marston, and I was sent this message 10 years ago, but I didn’t reply. A man came into my room that night and kidnapped me. Ever since that day, he slaps my bum every single day.</p>
        <p>It started as a joke to me, just another message online, but I didn’t realize the seriousness of it. Now, I live with the constant reminder of my mistake – the daily bum slaps.</p>
        <p>At first, I thought I could escape, but no matter where I ran, he always found me. He knows where I sleep, he knows when I'm awake, and the slaps never stop. They echo through the night, reminding me of my foolishness. My life has become a never-ending cycle of fear and slaps.</p>
        <p>If you don’t want this to happen to you, send this message to 10 people. Don’t make the same mistake I did, or you too may live in fear of the man who slaps.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Don’t ignore this warning. Share it with 10 people, or risk being next.</p>
